# Goal: Use a dictionary of animal -> sound. Ask for an animal and print its sound.
# Skills: dict, membership check, safe fallback for unknown animals, formatting.

sounds = {
    "dog": "Woof",
    "cat": "Meow",
    "cow": "Moo"

print("We know these animals:", ", ".join(sounds.keys()))

    print("I donâ€™t know that sound yet.")
    print("Tip: Try dog, cat, or cow.")
print("-" * 40)

# Extension idea (teacher demo during class):
# sounds[\"duck\"] = \"Quack\"
# print(\"Added duck to the dictionary! Now try typing 'duck'.\")
